# Kyousougiga Subtitles

DmonHiro (Commie) and official (?) PGS subs edited to fix issues on both. I've also used some random Russian subs for lines that didn't quite make sense.

This is not a definitive release as I've only fixed what I found incorrect based on context.

I'm an ESL and don't know Japanese. Regardless, I find this to be better than both releases.

My video source is Moozzi2, but this should also work for Judas and DmonHiro's releases. Just put the subtitles in the same folder and name them accordingly.
